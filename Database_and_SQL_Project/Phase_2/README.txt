The CreateTables_V2_0-1.sql file will create the tables for our database.

The inserts-1.sql file will populate those tables with a small amount of 
    sample data to test the queries.

The Queries.sql contains queries 1-22.

clearData.sql will run a SQL script that will clear all data held within the 
    database.

dropTables.sql will run a SQL script that will drop all the tables in the 
    database.
